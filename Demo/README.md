## Demo ##
The demo is very simple and shows the application of N-IPC for the reconstruction of deformations in masonry vaults. The .gh definition is ready and it takes less than six minutes to run, but I suggest opening the file, disabling the solver first.
In the example, meshes were used for both the template and target, and a simple and case-specific Grasshopper definition was used to define landmarks. Everything should be quite straightforward.
In the future, If I use N-ICP for other projects, Iâ€™ll probably add more meaningful examples.
