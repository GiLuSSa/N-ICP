## Demo ##
These demos are very simple and demonstrate the application of N-IPC in two simple cases.

**Cube** uses a sphere as a template and projects it into a target cube (brep) with the aid of a pair of landmarks. The aim of this demo is just to show the nonrigid nature of this registration.

 **Vault** is the application of N-ICP for the reconstruction of deformations in masonry vaults. In the example, meshes were used for both the template and target, and a simple and case-specific Grasshopper definition was used to define the landmarks. Everything should be quite straightforward.

The .gh definitions are ready and require less than six minutes to run, but I suggest disabling the solver before opening them.

In the future, If I use N-ICP for other projects, Iâ€™ll probably add more meaningful examples.
